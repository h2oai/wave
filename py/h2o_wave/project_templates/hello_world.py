# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to H2O Wave

This is a toy example for you to play around and show you the base concepts like:

* How to paint UI.
* How to handle interactivity (e.g. button click).
* How to work with application state.

You can edit **app.py** file, hit save and the app will automatically reload. Once you are done with playing around and want to get deeper knowledge of the framework itself, visit the [docs](https://wave.h2o.ai/) to learn more.

## âœ¨ Interactivity

Wave interactivity model is very simple: Every widget that is capable of user interaction populates a python q.args dictionary that developer can later handle in code. See the counter example in this app.
