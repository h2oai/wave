"""
Python package `h2o_wave` provides the Python driver for H2O Wave.

H2O Wave is a lightweight software stack for programming interactive web applications
entirely in Python (no HTML/Javascript/CSS) required.

It is designed to make it fast, fun and easy to build low-latency, realtime,
collaborative, web-based applications. It ships batteries-included with
a suite of form and data visualization components for rapidly prototyping
analytical and decision-support applications.

Wave's components work in conjunction with the Q relay server that facilitates
realtime state synchronization between Python and web browsers.
