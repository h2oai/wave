title: Graphics
---

H2O Q provides a versatile API for rendering vector graphics (SVG) backed by [data buffers](buffers.mdx).

Use the graphics card [ui.graphics_card()](http://localhost:3000/docs/api/ui#graphics_card) to render graphics.

## Stages and scenes

The graphics card has two attributes that control how graphics are rendered: `stage` and `scene`:
- A stage holds static shapes that are rendered as part of the background (literally, behind the scene).
- A scene holds shapes whose attributes need to be animated (causing a re-render, or, literally, cause a scene).

Use `ui.stage()` and `ui.scene()` to create the stage and the scene:
- `ui.stage()` creates a packed, static representation of its shapes (recall that the stage is not supposed to change).
- `ui.scene()` declares a data buffer to efficiently update its shapes if changed (recall that the scene is animated).

Here's an example that draws a clock with a circular `face` placed on the `stage`, and `hour`, `min` and `sec` hands placed in the `scene`:

```py
from h2o_q import site, ui, graphics as g

page = site['/demo']
page['example'] = ui.graphics_card(
    box='1 1 2 3', view_box='0 0 100 100', width='100%', height='100%',
    stage=g.stage(
        face=g.circle(cx='50', cy='50', r='45', fill='#111', stroke_width='2px', stroke='#f55'),
    ),
    scene=g.scene(
        hour=g.rect(x='47.5', y='12.5', width='5', height='40', rx='2.5', fill='#333', stroke='#555'),
        min=g.rect(x='48.5', y='12.5', width='3', height='40', rx='2', fill='#333', stroke='#555'),
        sec=g.line(x1='50', y1='50', x2='50', y2='16', stroke='#f55', stroke_width='1px'),
    ),
)
```

## Shapes

Use drawing functions to add shapes to the stage or scene:

| Primitive | Use |
|---|---|
| [arc()](api/graphics#arc) | Circular or annular sector, as in a pie or donut chart |
| [circle()](api/graphics#circle) | [Circle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/circle) |
| [ellipse()](api/graphics#ellipse) | [Ellipse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/ellipse) |
| [image()](api/graphics#image) | [Image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/image) |
| [line()](api/graphics#line) | [Line](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/line) |
| [path()](api/graphics#path) | [Path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/path) |
| [polygon()](api/graphics#polygon) | [Polygon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/polygon) |
| [polyline()](api/graphics#polyline) | [Polyline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/polyline) |
| [spline()](api/graphics#spline) | Curves (including radial curves) using various algorithms: basis, cardinal, smooth, linear, monotone, natural, step. |
| [rect()](api/graphics#rect) | [Rect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/rect) |
| [text()](api/graphics#text) | [Text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/text) |


## Paths

The `path()` function is special: it can draw arbitrary shapes. This is because SVG path elements support an attribute called `d` which holds drawing commands.

Here's a path that represents a red square:

```py
g.path(d='m 25 25 h 50 v 50 h -50 z', fill='red')
```

The above snippet produces:

```html
<path d='m 25 25 h 50 v 50 h -50 z' fill='red'/>
```

The drawing commands in the above example work like this:
1. `m 25 25`: Move 25px left, 25px down
2. `h 50`: Draw a line 50px right
3. `v 50`: Draw a line 50px down
4. `h -50`: Draw a line 50px left
5. `z`: Close the path (going back to where we started)

The little drawing syntax above is part of the SVG specification, not something unique to Q.

Authoring `path()` drawing commands by hand is tedious, so Q provides two utilities to make it easier: `p()` and `turtle()`.

## Drawing with paths

`p()` creates a path generator with convenience methods to draw step by step. For example, the following two lines are equivalent:

```py
red_square = g.path(d='m 25 25 h 50 v 50 h -50 z', fill='red')
red_square = g.p().m(25, 25).h(50).v(50).h(-50).z().path(fill='red')
```

### Commands

| Method | Use |
|---|---|
| `M()` | Move, absolute |
| `H()` | Horizontal line, absolute |
| `V()` | Vertical line, absolute |
| `L()` | Line, absolute |
| `A()` | Elliptical arc, absolute |
| `C()` | Cubic Bézier curve, absolute |
| `S()` | Cubic Bézier curve, smooth, absolute |
| `Q()` | Quadratic Bézier curve, absolute |
| `T()` | Quadratic Bézier curve, smooth, absolute |
| `Z()` | Close path |
| `m()` | Move, relative |
| `h()` | Horizontal line, relative |
| `v()` | Vertical line, relative |
| `l()` | Line, relative |
| `a()` | Elliptical arc, relative |
| `c()` | Cubic Bézier curve, relative |
| `s()` | Cubic Bézier curve, smooth, relative |
| `q()` | Quadratic Bézier curve, relative |
| `t()` | Quadratic Bézier curve, smooth, relative |
| `z()` | Close path |
| `d()` | Serialize this path's commands into SVG path data. |
| `path()` | Create a SVG path element |

:::info
The upper-cased commands use absolute coordinates. The lower-cased commands use relative coordinates. For example, `L(4,2)` means "draw a line to (4,2)", but `l(4,2)` means "draw a line 4px right, 2px down from the current position".

## Drawing with a turtle

`turtle()` creates a path generator (similar to `p()`), but using [Turtle Geometry](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

### Commands

| Method | Use |
|---|---|
| `pd()` | Pen down |
| `pu()` | Pen up |
| `p()` | Set the turtle's position |
| `a()` | Set the turtle's orientation |
| `f()` | Move forward |
| `b()` | Move backward |
| `l()` | Turn left |
| `r()` | Turn right |
| `d()` | Serialize this turtle's movements into SVG path data |
| `path()` | Create a SVG path element |


### Example

Here is an example from [Python's turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html):

![star](https://docs.python.org/3/_images/turtle-star.png)

Here is the above example recreated in Q:

```py
from turtle import *
color('red', 'yellow')
begin_fill()
while True:
    forward(200)
    left(170)
    if abs(pos()) < 1:
        break
end_fill()
done()
```

```py {3-6}
from h2o_q import site, ui, graphics as g

t = g.turtle().f(100).r(90).pd()
for _ in range(36):
    t.f(200).l(170)
spirograph = t.pu(1).path(stroke='red', fill='yellow')

page = site['/demo']
page['example'] = ui.graphics_card(
    box='1 1 2 3', view_box='0 0 220 220', width='100%', height='100%',
    scene=g.scene(foo=spirograph),
)

page.save()
```
