title: Migrating from pre-alpha

Before you begin, it is highly recommended that you [download](https://github.com/h2oai/qd/releases) a release and run the interactive `tour.py` that ships with the release to get a feel for what Q programs look like in practice.

## What has changed?

From an app-development perspective, the most important change is that Q is more of a library rather than a framework.

With the previous framework, the only way to execute an app was via the Q server. This limitation has been removed. The script/app you author is just a regular Python program in which you `import h2o_q` and execute via:

- The command line: `python3 my_script.py`.
- In the Python REPL.
- In a Jupyter notebook.
- In your favorite IDE (PyCharm, VSCode, etc.).

This also means that you can apply breakpoints and debug or step-through your program in your debugger of choice.

From an information architecture perspective, control has been inverted: instead of your app being an extension to Q's data/prep/search features, Q's features are now optional additions to your app, and your app takes center stage. Implementation-wise, instead of your app running in a sidebar inside of Q's UI, your app now occupies the entire UI.

## Breaking changes

#### Removed: `@Q.app`, `@Q.ui` annotations.

Instead, define a `async` request-handling function, say `main()`, and pass that function to `listen()`, like this:

```py
from h2o_q import Q, listen

async def main(q: Q):
  pass

listen('/my/app/route', main)
```

#### Removed: `q.wait()`, `q.show()`, `q.fail()`, `q.exit()`.

The above four methods were the primary mechanism to make changes to your app's UI. They have all been replaced with a single `h2o_q.core.Page.save()` method.

The new technique is:
1. Access the page or card you want to modify.
1. Modify the page or card.
1. Call `h2o_q.core.Page.save()` to save your changes and update the browser page.

Before:
```py
q.wait(
  callback_function,
  ui.text('Step 1'),
  ui.button(name='next', label='Next'),
)
```

After:
```py
q.page['my_card'] = ui.form_card(
  # A card with its top-left corner at column 1, row 5; 2 columns wide and 4 rows high.
  box='1 5 2 4',
  items=[
    ui.text('Step 1'),
    ui.button(name='next', label='Next'),
  ],
)
await q.page.save()
```

Note that the *After* example requires a `box` that specifies where to draw your form. This is because you are not limited to using a sidebar, and can use the entire width/length of the page.

The same technique can be used to update the UI again (or display intermediate results):

Before:
```py
q.wait(
  callback_function,
  ui.text('Step 2'),
  ui.button(name='next', label='Next'),
)
```

After:
```py
# Don't have to recreate the entire form again; simply replace its items and save the page.
q.page['my_card'].items = [
  ui.text('Step 2'),
  ui.button(name='next', label='Next'),
]
await q.page.save()
```

#### Removed: callback functions for request-handling.

Q apps are 100% push-based, using duplex communication instead of a request/reply paradigm. There is no need to have a tangled mess of callbacks to handle UI events.

Instead, all requests are routed to a single function, and you can decide how to organize your application logic by branching on `q.args.*`.

Before:
```py
def step1(q: Q):
  q.wait(
    step2,
    ui.text('Step 1'),
    ui.button(name='next', label='Next'),
  )

def step2(q: Q):
  q.wait(
    step3,
    ui.text('Step 2'),
    ui.button(name='next', label='Next'),
  )

def step3(q: Q):
  q.wait(
    step4,
    ui.text('Step 3'),
    ui.button(name='next', label='Next'),
  )
```

After:
```py
async def main(q: Q):
  if q.args.step2:
    items = [
      ui.text('Step 2'),
      ui.button(name='step3', label='Next'),
    ]
  elif q.args.step3:
    items = [
      ui.text('Step 3'),
      ui.button(name='step4', label='Next'),
    ]
  else:
    items = [
      ui.text('Step 1'),
      ui.button(name='step2', label='Next'),
    ]

  q.page['my_card'].items = items
  await q.page.save()

listen('/my/app/route', main)
```

#### Removed: `q.dashboard()` and `q.notebook()`.

Every page in Q is a dashboard page. Instead of creating a separate dashboard or notebook, simply add cards to a page and arrange it the way you want. Cards can be created by using one of the several `ui.*_card()` APIs. Also see the [dashboard](#dashboard), [layout](#layout-position) and [sizing](#layout-size) examples to learn how to lay out several cards on a page.

If you want to display a notebook-style vertical stack of markdown, html or other content, use `h2o_q.ui.text()` and `h2o_q.ui.frame()` contained inside a `h2o_q.ui.form_card()`, like this:

Before:
```py
ui.notebook([ui.notebook_section([
  ui.markdown_cell(content='Foo'),
  ui.frame_cell(source=html_foo, height='200px'),
  ui.markdown_cell(content='Bar'),
  ui.frame_cell(source=html_bar, height='200px'),
])])

```

After: Note the parameter name change `frame_cell(source=...)` to `frame(content=...)`.

```py
ui.form_cell(
  box='1 5 2 4',
  items=[
    ui.text(content='Foo'),
    ui.frame(content=html_foo, height='200px'),
    ui.text(content='Bar'),
    ui.frame(content=html_bar, height='200px'),
  ],
)
```


#### Changed: `ui.buttons()`, `ui.expander()` and `ui.tabs()` accept a `list` of items instead of var args `*args`.

Before:
```py
ui.buttons(ui.button(...), ui.button(...), ui.button(...))
```

After:
```py
ui.buttons([ui.button(...), ui.button(...), ui.button(...)]) # Note enclosing [ ]
```

#### Changed: `q.upload()` changed to `q.site.upload()`.

The `upload()` method has been moved to the `h2o_q.core.Site` instance, since each `h2o_q.core.Site` represents a distinct server, and makes it possible to control multiple sites from a single Python script.

#### Changed: `q.args.foo=` changed to `q.client.foo=`.

Setting attributes on `q.args` (e.g. `q.args.foo = 'bar'`) is no longer preserved between requests. This was the primary mechanism employed previously to preserve data between requests.

Instead, Q provides 4 mechanisms for preserving data between requests:

1. **Process-level**: Use global variables.
1. **App-level**: Use `q.app.foo = 'bar'` to save; access `q.app.foo` to read it back again.
1. **User-level**: Use `q.user.foo = 'bar'` to save; access `q.user.foo` to read it back again.
1. **Client-level**: Use `q.client.foo = 'bar'` to save; access `q.client.foo` to read it back again.

Here, *Client* refers to a distinct tab in a browser.

If you want to rely on the old behavior of preserving `q.args` for the lifetime of the application, copy `q.args` to `q.client` like this:

```py
from h2o_q import copy_expando

copy_expando(q.args, q.client, exclude_keys=['back2', 'select_target', 'restart'])
```

#### Changed: No need to JSON-serialize values to preserve them between requests.

`q.args.foo=` only supported JSON-serialized values. No such restrictions exist for the `q.app`, `q.user` and `q.client` containers. You could, for example, load a Pandas dataframe and set `q.user.df = my_df`, and the dataframe will be accessible across requests for the lifetime of the app.
