To set up H2O Q, simply download and extract a release (~8MB). The release ships with a precompiled binary executable, so no explicit installation step is necessary.

## Prerequisites

H2O Q runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, having Python 3.6.1 or later.

## Setup

### Step 1: Download

[Download the H2O Q SDK](https://github.com/h2oai/qd/releases/latest) for your platform.

### Step 2: Extract

Extract your download.

```shell
tar -xzf qd-x.y.z-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
### Step 3: Move

Move it to a convenient location, say `$HOME/q/`.

```shell
 mv qd-x.y.z-linux-amd64 $HOME/q
```

:::note
If you have a previous version of H2O Q installed, be sure to remove it before installing another. To remove it, simply delete the previous directory.
:::

Inspect your `$HOME/q` directory. You should see the following content:

```
.
├── docs/           ... Documentation
├── examples/       ... Examples
├── test/           ... Browser testing framework
├── www/            ... Q server web root (do not modify!)
└── qd              ... Q server executable
```

### Step 4: Run

Go to your H2O Q directory.

```shell
cd $HOME/q
```

Start the H2O Q server.

```shell
./qd
```

```

2020/10/01 01:27:35 #  / __ `/ __  /
2020/10/01 01:27:35 # / /_/ / /_/ /

2020/10/01 01:27:35 #   /_/

2020/10/01 01:27:35 # {"address":":55555","t":"listen","webroot":"/home/elp/q/www"}

```

### Step 5: Verify

Finally, point your web browser to [http://localhost:55555/](http://localhost:55555/). You should see an empty page with a spinner that looks like this:

<p><img alt="spinner" src={useBaseUrl('assets/docs/installation__waiting.png')} /></p>

Congratulations! H2O Q is now running, but doesn't have any content yet (hence the spinner).

In the next few sections, we'll add some content and see what the fuss is all about.
