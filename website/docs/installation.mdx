## Install

:::important
These instructions apply to v0.20 or later. For previous versions, [click here](/docs/installation-8-20).
:::

Install the `h2o-wave` package from PyPI:

```shell
pip install h2o-wave
```

To install in a virtual environment (recommended):

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install h2o-wave
```

To install in a virtual environment (Windows):

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install h2o-wave
```

To install using Conda:

```shell
conda config --append channels conda-forge
conda install -c h2oai h2o-wave
```

To install in a Conda virtual environment:

```shell
conda create -n venv
conda activate venv
conda config --append channels conda-forge
conda install -c h2oai h2o-wave
```

:::info
Conda packaging does not contain Wave server which means, you will still need to run the wave server (waved) yourself. See how to run it [here](/docs/installation-8-20#setup).
:::

## Project templates

Once the installation part is complete, you can use `wave init` command to pick a [predefined app template](/docs/project-templates) that will bootstrap your first app and give you a head start when building your Wave apps.

## Interactive learning

If you don't feel like going through the docs because you are more of a hands-on person, you can try our Wave University app.

Within your activated virtual environment, run:

```sh
wave learn
```

The command requires `h2o_wave_university` to be installed. To do that, run:

```sh
pip install h2o_wave_university
```

:::tip
Wave University is a standalone package that can be pip-installed and run independently. After installation, you will be able to launch it via `wave-university` command within your python environment.
:::

## Download examples

Run `wave fetch` to download app examples, demos, and the interactive tour.

```shell
(venv) $ wave fetch

Fetching examples and related files. Please wait...
Downloading https://github.com/h2oai/wave/releases/download/v0.20.0/wave-0.20.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
Extracting...

All additional files downloaded and extracted successfully!
Examples and tour............. /home/wave/examples
Demos and layout samples...... /home/wave/demo
Automated test harness........ /home/wave/test
Wave daemon for deployments... /home/wave
```

You should now have access to 200+ examples locally.

:::info
On recent versions of OSX, it's possible to run into certificate verification errors while running `wave fetch`, specifically `urllib.error.URLError: urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate`. To fix this problem, navigate to `Application/Python 3.7` on your system and execute `Install Certificates.command`.
:::

## Run the tour

The Wave tour is a Wave app that lets you play with all the examples interactively.

![tour](assets/tour__tour.png)

To run the tour, simply launch `examples/tour.py` like this:

```shell
cd wave
pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
wave run --no-reload examples.tour
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:10101/tour](http://localhost:10101/tour) to access the tour.

`tour.py` is an ordinary Wave app that runs other apps. The tour itself runs at the route `/tour`, and each of the examples runs at `/demo`.

:::tip
To play with the tour's active example in isolation, simply open a new browser tab and head to [http://localhost:10101/demo](http://localhost:10101/demo).

## Downloading Wave

If you would like to run Wave server manually (e.g. for [deployment](/docs/deployment)), you can download it either from here or from our [Github releases](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/releases).

If you are unsure which package to pick, here is a helper table:

| **Your OS** | **Wave server** |  **Python client** |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|:------------------:|
|     Mac     |   darwin-amd64  | macosx_10_9_x86_64 |
|    Mac M1   |   darwin-arm64  |  macosx_11_0_arm64 |
|   Windows   |  windows-amd64  |      win_amd64     |
|    Linux    |   linux-amd64   |  manylinux1_x86_64 |

## Early adopters

For people who simply cannot wait until next release and would like to try the new cool feature merged just a day ago, we also provide so-called "**nightly builds**". These are builds that are released daily (over night).

We highly encourage using nightly builds as they allow catching possible regressions ahead of an official release. So please, if you spot something weird that is not happening in the latest release,
[file an issue](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md).

To use nightly: 

* Go to [nightly release page](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/releases/tag/nightly).
* Download the appropriate `.whl` file for your OS.
* Run `pip install <downloaded-nightly>.whl` (this is an alternative to `pip install h2o-wave` with official releases).

:::tip
It's possible to include the local `.whl` file directly within your `requirements.txt` if needed.

## Smoother dev experience

For Wave-specific IDE autocomplete and additional snippets that will make your life way easier, we recommend installing [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=h2oai.h2o-wave) or [Jetbrains Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18530-h2o-wave) depending on the IDE of your choice.
Feel free to read more at [this](/blog/h2o-wave-vscode-extension) and [this](/blog/h2o-wave-pycharm-plugin) blog posts.

## Wrapping up

In this section, we installed Wave and then launched `tour.py` to experience the tour. In general, this is how you'd typically launch any app, including your own. There is nothing special about `tour.py`. In fact, to run any example, all you need to do is repeat the steps above in a new terminal window. For example, to run `todo.py`, simply run:

```shell
wave run examples.todo
```

You can now access the example at [http://localhost:10101/demo](http://localhost:10101/demo). Simple!
