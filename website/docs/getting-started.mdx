H2O Q lets you build and deploy amazing realtime analytics with dramatically less effort.

## What is H2O Q?

H2O Q is a software stack for building beautiful, low-latency, realtime, browser-based applications and dashboards entirely in Python without using HTML, Javascript or CSS.

It excels at capturing data, visualizations, and graphics from multiple sources, and broadcasting them live over the web.

## What can I do with it?

H2O Q gives your Python programs the ability to push content to connected clients as it happens, in realtime. In other words, it lets your program display up-to-date information without asking your users to hit their browser's reload button.

You can use H2O Q for:
- Dashboards and visualizations for live monitoring.
- Live information displays: news, tickers, health, or performance data.
- Apps that require instant notifications, updates, events, or alerts.
- Apps that involve messaging: chat, bots, etc.
- Collaborative apps: whiteboards, sharing, etc.

You can also use H2O Q when you find yourself reaching for a web application framework - it can handle regular (non-realtime) apps just fine.

## How do I use it?

H2O Q's mental model is simple, but powerful[^1]:
1. Your instance holds a collection of pages.
2. To change a page, simply grab a reference to a page, change it, and save it.

That's it. Your changes are now visible to everyone.

This simplicity makes it fast, fun and easy to rapidly build and deploy interactive applications without having to reason about client/server, HTTP request/response, browser quirks, and front-end development.

The API is concise and elegant, freeing you to create in broad strokes, tackling high level ideas first, and polishing up the details later.

## Show me some code!

Here's a bean counter. Clicking the button increments the bean count:

<video controls loop><source src={useBaseUrl('assets/docs/getting-started__beans.mp4')} type='video/mp4'/></video>

And here's how it's written:

```py {8-9,16}
from h2o_q import Q, listen, ui

bean_count = 0

async def serve(q: Q):
    global bean_count
    # Was the 'increment' button clicked?
    if q.args.increment:
        bean_count += 1

    # Display a form on the page
    q.page['beans'] = ui.form_card(
        box='1 1 1 2',
        items=[
            ui.text_xl('Beans!'),
            ui.button(name='increment', label=f'{bean_count} beans'),
        ],
    )

    # Save the page
    await q.page.save()

listen('/counter', serve)
```

## What's included?

The SDK ships batteries-included with a wide variety of user interface widgets and charts. You also get to use your favorite Python libraries seamlessly - anything that works in a Jupyter notebook works in H2O Q - including Altair, Bokeh, H2O, Keras, Matplotlib, Plotly, PyTorch, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Vega-lite, and others. H2O Q lets you use and broadcast results from all these libraries, in realtime.

H2O Q is not only a programming toolkit but a programmable content server  as well: it can capture, retain, and relay information efficiently in realtime. The content server (or *Q Server*) is written in Go, a ~10MB static executable without runtime dependencies[^2]. It currently ships with a Python language driver, but is language-agnostic (an R language driver is under development).

The Q Server stores all the content and acts as a hub between your user's web browser and your apps. Therefore, it must be up and running before you launch Q apps. Typically, you only need one Q Server to serve several apps.

                       |

                       |
                       |              +---------+
                       +------------->+ app3.py |
                                      +---------+

```




## In Summary

H2O Q is rapid application development for a more... civilized age[^3].

Also, this page was mostly hyperbole, so let's download it and take it for a spin, shall we.
