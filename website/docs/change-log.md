## Versioning

H2O Wave and its Python driver follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Major releases ship every six months (~February and ~August), while minor and patch releases may ship as often as every week. Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes.

When referencing the [`h2o-wave` package](https://pypi.org/project/h2o-wave/) from your `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`, you should always use a version constraint such as `>=4.2, <5` (any version 4.2 or greater, but less than 5), since major releases of H2O Wave do include breaking changes.

## Support Policy

For LTS releases, bug fixes are provided for 2 years and security fixes are provided for 3 years. These releases provide the longest window of support and maintenance. For general releases, bug fixes are provided for 6 months and security fixes are provided for 1 year.
