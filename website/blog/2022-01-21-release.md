It's been a while since the last `0.19` release, but the wait is worth it. The newest Wave includes plenty of useful features that aim to ease the development process and make your Wave apps more appealing. In this post, we explore the most important features that shipped with `0.20`.

<!--truncate-->

## Simpler, faster installation experience

Until the `0.20` version, it was necessary to manually download the Wave server (`waved`) from [our Github releases page](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/releases), extract and run it prior to running your app. This step is no longer necessary. 

Starting with `0.20`, all you need to do is `pip install h2o_wave` and `wave run your-app`. The Wave server is automatically started for you.

```shell
(venv) $ wave run
```

Note that this simplification is aimed for development only. For production deployments, you might want to pass additional configuration options to waved (not possible with `wave run`) or even switch your python ASGI server (see [deployment docs](/docs/deployment#deploying-wave-apps)).

If you for, some reason, do not want to start `waved` during `wave run`, you can turn it off via `H2O_WAVE_NO_AUTOSTART` env variable.

All the examples and Tour app were previously included in the release. This is not the case with `pip install` though. If you would still like to have all the examples accessible locally, just run `wave fetch` to download examples, demos, and the interactive tour.

```shell
(venv) $ wave fetch
```

You should now have access to 200+ examples locally.

## Base URL support

By default, Wave apps are all hosted at the root path `/`. This path can be customized by specifying a route via, say, `@app('/foo')` or `site['/foo']`. Starting with v0.20, you can additionally specify a base URL, so that all the apps or sites hosted by a Wave server are served at a path other than `/`. 

Using this feature, specifying a base URL, say `/my/apps`, will make your apps available at `/my/apps/app1`, `/my/apps/app2`, and so on.

To enable a base URL, launch `waved` with `-base-url` or launch `waved` with `$H2O_WAVE_BASE_URL`. Setting base URL to `/foo/` will allow serving an app with route `/` at `/foo/`, or an app with route `/bar` at `/foo/bar/`. Accessing `/foo/`'s parent(s) from either a browser or API call will return a 404 error. If a base URL is set, an app must be launched with `$H2O_WAVE_BASE_URL` set to the same base URL value.

## Card and component documentation

The documentation now includes a whole new section on [Widgets](/docs/widgets/overview), which includes explanations and examples on how to best use each of the cards and components available in Wave. This is a work in progress, and will be improved over time. We've tried to include screenshots of each example wherever possible, which should make it easier for you to browse, copy and adapt the sample code for your apps.

## Component additions/improvements

This release contains a lot of bugfixes and small features that are not worth mentioning from a general overview point of view. Instead, here is a list of the most significant component changes and additions.

### Header

The header received 3 new attributes:

* `items` - Components that should be displayed on the right side of the header.
* `secondary_items` - Items that should be displayed in the center of the header
* `color` - Header background color. Available colors are 'card' | 'transparent' | 'primary'. Defaults to 'primary'.

Sidebar (`ui.nav`) got 4 new attributes:

* `image` - The logo displayed at the top.
* `persona` - The user avatar displayed at the top.
* `secondary_items` - Items that should be displayed at the bottom of the card if items are not empty, otherwise displayed under subtitle.
* `color` - Card background color. Available colors are `'card'` and `'primary'`. Defaults to `'card'`.

## New Themes

v0.20 includes a dozen new built-in themes to choose from. Most of the themes were inspired by popular editor/IDE themes of the same name. If you have ideas for other themes that would be useful to have in Wave, please [let us know](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/discussions)!

If you are unsure how to use these, checkout the [docs](/docs/color-theming).
