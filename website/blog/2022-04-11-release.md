Today, we are proud to announce a new Wave version - 0.21 with support for server-side tables, Apple M1 chip, plot improvements and plenty of new widgets.

## Let your table handle any data regardless of size

In previous versions, all the data passed to `ui.table` as rows were sent all at once to browser. All operations (sorting, filtering etc.) were happening in browser, which has its limits. These were approximately around 100k rows with 10 cols in order to keep the UX smooth. However, if a developer needed to display larger data, let's say in order of milions, there was no way to make it happen.

This release adds support for pagination and lets developers handle all the operations in form of events (`'search'`, `'sort'`, `'filter'`, `'download'`, `'page_change'`, `'reset'`). See [complete example](docs/examples/table-pagination) for a comprehensive example. Also note that you can use any arbitrary data source like SQL, [pandas dataframe](docs/examples/table-pagination-pandas) or [H2OFrame](docs/examples/table-pagination-h2o3).
