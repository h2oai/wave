[Wave v0.14 is released](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/releases/tag/v0.14.0). This is mainly a security, performance, and bugfix release. The release also includes experimental support for building and controlling Wave dashboards using the R programming language.

## Highlights

The Wave server now ships with a built-in utility to generate, use, and manage API keys conveniently. See [Security](https://wave.h2o.ai/docs/security).

The Wave server also provides additional control over how it handles external requests. See [Configuration](https://wave.h2o.ai/docs/configuration).

Additionally, starting v0.14, Python app servers now only process requests originating from the Wave server. The API key/secret pair for accessing the app server is automatically generated for each launch, and can be overridden using the new `H2O_WAVE_APP_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `H2O_WAVE_APP_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` for development and testing, if required. See [Configuration](https://wave.h2o.ai/docs/configuration).

Adding R language support also introduced major changes and simplification in the backend app and communication protocols, which should make it simpler to ship support for interactive R web apps in the near future.

All the work that has gone into this release sets the stage for adding support for many more languages, scripting and command-line control of content and visualizations displayed in Wave.
