/**
 * Create a progress bar.
 *
 * Progress bars are used to show the completion status of an operation lasting more than 2 seconds.
 * If the state of progress cannot be determined, do not set a value.
 * Progress bars feature a bar showing total units to completion, and total units finished.
 * The label appears above the bar, and the caption appears below.
 * The label should tell someone exactly what the operation is doing.
 *
 * Examples of formatting include:
 * [Object] is being [operation name], or
 * [Object] is being [operation name] to [destination name] or
 * [Object] is being [operation name] from [source name] to [destination name]
 *
 * Status text is generally in units elapsed and total units.
 * Real-world examples include copying files to a storage location, saving edits to a file, and more.
 * Use units that are informative and relevant to give the best idea to users of how long the operation will take to complete.
 * Avoid time units as they are rarely accurate enough to be trustworthy.
 * Also, combine steps of a complex operation into one total bar to avoid “rewinding” the bar.
 * Instead change the label to reflect the change if necessary. Bars moving backwards reduce confidence in the service.
