# Lesson 3: Flex Layout
# # Flex layout - the responsive way
# If you would like your Wave app/script to look good on every screen (make it [responsive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)), you need to go for
# a flex layout. Flex standing for flexible.
# 
# The layout will be specified in a card called `meta_card` which is used for not directly visible page configuration like layout or color theme for example.
# Basic building block of the layout is called `ui.zone` which allows you to specify it's direction (row/col), alignment or size.
# 
# Good news is that layout tries to adjust itself based on the card content which means minimal unnecessary whitespace and scrollbars by default.
# 
# See [docs](https://wave.h2o.ai/docs/layout#flex-layout) for further info.
# 
# ## Your task
# Try to add a new card to the "bottom zone". Note: You will need to come up with a page key that doesn't exist yet in order to not overwrite the existing card. You cannot pick "top_hello" for example.
# 
# As an extra task, open new tab at `/demo` path and verify if it really looks good on bigger screen size. If you are running this app locally, the URL would be
# <http://localhost:10101/demo>.
