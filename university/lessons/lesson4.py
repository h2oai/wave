# Lesson 4: World of Widgets
# # Let's add some bells and whistles!
# One of the Wave's main advantages against our competitors is it's large collections of highly polished, ready-to-use widgets.
# Please go through the [list of all the widgets](https://wave.h2o.ai/docs/widgets/overview#content) and find the ones that best fit your usecase.
# ## Your task
# Try to replace the body right-hand side (RHS) and left-hand side(LHS) with a widget of your choice from the above linked list.
